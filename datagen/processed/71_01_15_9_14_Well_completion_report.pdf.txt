Thi section of the report is designed to provie an on-site, fresh description of lithologies with a view to aiding future reports ana prognoses. AL depths referred to are from RKB. All formation tops are deduced from data available at the time. 1 TERTIARY From 190 M (30" casing shoe at 187 M) sampling conmenced whilst Grilling the 12 1/4" hole, utilising the marine riser. A fairly uniform section of alternating sand and sticky "gumbo" clays was encountered, the sand between 130 and 320 M being particularly well developed in thickness, consisting of clear loose, fine to medium ized sub rounded quart® grain: ‘The clays in the section were typlically grey, soft, soluble and amphorous, often containing shell fragments. These clays persisted to 925 M changing in colour with depth to a green-grey variety, and again containing thin stringers of sand. A Grilling break of 400+ M/HR at 925 M indicated the top of the Utsira and a corresponding increase in gas levels to 0.4% (Cz only) maximum. Loose clear wand of mediun to fine grain size, showing traces of cementation and often containing abundant shell fragment: extended down to 1074 M, where again, grey and olive green soft clays became the predominant lithology, having an increasing silty content with depth. From 1257 M to 1305 Ma further well developed sand vas encountered, again appearing in surface as loose, white or clear fine to medium grains. At 1305 Ma change to grey and brown silty claystones and a reduction in ROP to 40M/HR marked the top of the Oligocene. Between 1890 M and 1950 M orange-brown hard limestone stringers appeared, corresonding to the top of the Eocene before reverting back to the aformetioned silty claystones. A positive drilling break to 115 M/HR maximum at 204fmand a bhange in‘ lithology to clear, white and light brown, fine grained sand, often with calcareous cement, is taken as the top of the Frigg formation, Ss the sands persisting erratically to 221 M and becoming increaseingly well cemented with depth before reverting to green-grey micaceous and pyritous claystones with thin limestone stringers. Gas levels throughout the sand remained low ané no hydrocarbon shows were seen. ‘The Balder formation, approximating to the top of the Palaeocene, appeared in cuttings samples at 2330 M, being blue grey, cream containing small black volcanic inclusions and being slightly clacareous, and persisted in traces to 2425 M. Claystones below the Balder were of a red-brown varity, typical of the Palaeocene and cont aining frequent thin , hard limestone stringers, easily picked out from the drilling porosity plot. ‘The first occurence of Palaeccene sand (Heimdal) corresponded with an increase in ROP at 2550 M and a marked shift in the "A" Exponent. and drilling porosity trend lines. These sande were often interbedded initially with green-grown claystones and thin very hard limestone stingers, but became more persistant by 2625 M ,grading into a very fine grained sandstone, well cemented with a calcite cement. Gas levels increased in the sandswith a maximum of 4x (Ci only) at th top. No shows were seen in the sandstone which extended to 2685 M. There then followed a short 15 metre section of claystone of a Light grey, light green variety before a sudden and marked change in formation to light grey marls, well picked out by calcimetry tests at 2703 N. . 2. CRETACEOUS The exact top of the Ekofisk formation is somewhat difficult to pick due to the gradational change in formation from the above- mentioned marls to chalk. ‘The chalk first appears conclusively at 2729 M, being typically white and soft-but no containing hydro~ carbon accumulations, as can be seen by the rapidly reducing gas levels as the chalk was arilled.. Although this section of the well was drilled with a turbine assembly and Lynx bit, no problems were encountered with cuttings volune or nature, and sufficient cuttings were available for sample analysis requirenents. THE ANALYSTS Soe By 2825 M the chalk had changed to @ pink variety, more properly termed limestone, which increased in hardness with depth, becoming very hard by 2915 M. A change to a light grey and red brovn marl (Plenus Marl) at 2945 and associated grey green, dark and light brown claystones with a slight increase in background gas levels persisted to 2975 M, when once again, white and pink limestones became the predominant lithology down to 3045 M. At 3045 Ma light grey Marl (Sola Formation) and subsequent white claystones and brown siltstones occurred, and eventually by 3127 M the bi of the main limestone body had been passed, brick red claystones becoming dominant. URASSIC ‘The brick red claystone mentioned aboveare thought to mark the top of the Kinmeridigan in this locality, although the more typical associated increase in gas levels did not occur until 3175 (maximum 0,4% with C1, C2 and C3 being present) in dark grey and occassionally brown claystones and siltstones. Subsequent electric logs served to further subdivide the Cretaceous/Jurassic boundary ‘area. In retrospect, comparison can be seen between logs. ‘The increase in marl at 3072 M and the pronounced “spike” on the "A" Exponent and drilling porosity plots at 3070 correspond closely with the top of the Hidra formation, placed at 3075 M. again a change from the marls and limestones to the abovementioned brick red claystones at 3127 M and another kick in the “A* Exponent and Grilling porosity plots at 3129 M correspond closely with the top of the Redby at 3131 M. Increases in “AY Exponent and drilling porosity to a maximum at 3176 M corresponding with increased mud gas levels and the incoming of dark grey siltsones and silty clay- stones, correspond exactly with the top of the Kimmeridge Clay, picked from “E* logs also at 3176 M. A fairly short section of Kimmeridigan was encountered in this well and at 3224 Ma drilling break to 15 M/HR from 3 M/BR signalled the top of the Jurassic sands (Hugin being placed at 3226 M). The first core was cut from 3228 M to 3243 M and recovered 42. Gas THE ANALYSTS Seo levels in the sand increased to 0.5% maximum, with Cy, Cy and C3 being present, and up to 10% fluorescence was seenin the sand- at 3255 M being dull yellow'to orange, with a very slow streaming white solvent cut. The lithology in this section was varied, being interbedded sandstone, grading to siltstone, with thin coal seams. The sand stone was white and brown, poorly cemented with a calcareous cement, very fine grained, sub angular to sub rounded, grading to silt size. A further drill break to 17 M/HR from 10 M/HR at 3260 marked the probable top of the Sleipner sand (subsequently placed at 3262 4 by "E" logs). Gas levels increased to 0.7% max at 3261 M with Cy, C2 and C3 again being present, and up to 10x fluorescence in the cuttings samples , being dull yellow with a slow streaming white solvent cut from the sand stone of a slightly coarser grain size. A cut from 3267 M to 3286 M and recovered 100%. whilst Grilling through the sand section the drilling porosity plot was very useful in determining sand and coal section and corresponded closely with that seen in the cores. Normally drillin then resuned to T.D in an essentially sandstone sequence, interbedded with siltstones, limestones and claystones. Gas levels throughout the section remained low with a maximum of 0.2% ‘at 3462 M, corresponding to a drilling break of 80 M/HR from 20-30 M/HR. Methane was the only component present. ‘The sand in the section was generally fine to medium clear quartz, often loose or poorly cemented with calcite, containing some visible porosity, but with no hydrocarbon shown. The sands were occassionally puncturated by thin hard srtingers of silty claystone and claystone, being grey to black and brown to red in colour, but below 3485 M the clayatone changed to a predominantely white or cream colour. By 3540 M the ROP slowed from 10-20 W/HR to 2-4 M/HR until 7.D at 3563 M, corresponding with a large increase in the claystone content in the samples, and some white microcrystalline limestone fron 3536 M to 3557 M. ston second core ws THE ANALYSTS Setorod ‘PRESSURE A large number of parameters were. collected, plotted and evaluated in order to determine the pore pressure regime dowhole as the well was drilled. IDEL pore pressure ,"D" Exponent shale factor, formation bulk density, delta chlorides, delta temperature, gas levels whilst drilling, whilst tripping and during connection, cuttings shape and size were all used in order to construct a complete a picture as possible. Clear definite trends are recognisable, and it is intended to compare and contrast the results from observations and discuss the merits and discrepancies (if any) of the observations. Reference need be made of the well completion/pressure log. ‘TOP HOLE to 13 3/8" CASING POINT Well defined "D" Exponent trend lines, sonic plots and IDEL data showed a normally pressured regime existed for much of the top hole section. Shale factor remained fairly constant in the clay sections, varying between a figure of 12 and 16 with no marked changes being seen. Mud weights through the section varied from 1.08 S.G below the 30" casing shoe to 1-12 S.G. at 13 3/8" casing point at 1371 M. Background gas levels were low until 13 3/8" casing point was reached. Both the "D" Exponent plot and the sonic plot show trend line changes below the Miocene sands at1073 M, also shown as irregularitie: fon the"A" Exponent plot. It is thought that below the sands some pressure irregularities may have existed. Lithology below the sand was essentially silty claystone with interbeds of sand. Although the overall pri normal 1.03-1.04 8.G. it is thought that localised abnormally pressured sections, increasing to a value of 1.10 S.G max at 1250M mayhave been responsible for any tight hole problems encountered during trips. This would certainly explain the deviation from the normal compaction trends si eventually resulting in trend line reversals on "D" Exponent, "a" Exponent and sonic plots from 1325 to 1400 M,with increases in gas levels from 0.1% background to 0.5% maximum at 1335 M-associated jure regime for the section w THE ANALYSTS Sata trip gases being of the order of 1.3% compared with figures of 0.1-0.5% for trips higher up the section. In conclusion it can be seen that this section of hole presents some interesting points. The section was drilled using 1.12 8.0. Mua and many sections of sand were penetrated. No flow occurred and for much of the section normal pore pressure must have existed, but trend anomolies in “D" Exponent “A” Exponent and sonic plots of local duration, along with slight increases in shale factor readings (although this is not too clear) and increased trip and background gas levels all point to localised abnormally pressure sections with subsequent regression to normal 1.03-1.04 pore pressure. Of course this explanation of hole conditions in this section would explain problens during trips due to heaving and sloughing of abnormally pressured zones. Alternatively, basing observations on the delta chloride plot wich tends to show large negative peaks in these sections, excessive hydration of the clays was the sole agent responsible. 13.3/8" CASING porNT To 9 5/8" CASING POINT From 13 3/8" casing point (1371M) to the top of the Cretaceous tablished showing an overall normal 1.03-1.04 pore pressure, but with local irregularities in sections between 1785-1800M, 1940-2010 M and possibly from 2200-2350M. Shale factor readings in the: zones also tended to be higher ( although discrepancies do exist). Background gas levels through the sections remained low and fairly constant at 0.1%-0.2%, but trip and wiper gases (usually 0.2%-0.4%)tended to be much higher ( 1.1% max.) Mud weights were increased in stages at 1600, 1875, 2225 & 2600M from 1.12 to 1.25 5.G. No real reduction in ROP was seen to correspond to the mud weight increases and so a proable high overbalance existed troughout most of the section (apart from the above) and pore pressure remained at 1.03-1.04 S.c. at approx. 2730M, normal trend lines were again No unusual trends were noted in the Paleocene and normal pore pressure was calculated, extending down into the top of the Cretaceous chalk. Due to the change in rock type from clay- stone to Limestone and the added fact that the section was Schlumberger turbodrilled, some difficulty could be expected with drilling parameters, but once trend lines had been established for the most part "D" Exponent and “A” Exponesnt plots continued to point to normal 1.03-1.04 S.G. pore pressure. (Shale factor, bulk density and sonic plots all being of no real value in a limestone sequence). At 2850M IDEL pore pressure began to rise steeply in the shal trend reve: below the limestone and "D" Exponent began to show a 1, pore pressure rising to 1.10 S.G. by 3016 M (9 5/8" casing point). 2 5/2" int to T.D (35631 From 9 5/8" casing point IDEL pore pressure continued at 1,10 S.G. to 3125M, through the interbedded shales and lime~ stones of the lower cretaceous, but at the base of the Cretaceous pore pressure began to rise steeply, reaching 1.24 S.c. at the top of the Jurassic sands at 3222M. Shale factor readings at this depth are of no realvalue due to the effect of subserial explosure at the Base Cretaceous Unconformity, but bulk density readings between the base of the limestons at 3125M and the top of the sands, do show an overall reduction in value from 2.00-1.80 S.C. further pointing to increasing pore pressure. Gas levela at this depth are thought to be more typically due to the nature of the Kimeridge Clay itself, being carbonaceous, rather than pressure, but levels do tend to increase towards the top of the Juri sands as pore pressure, rises to a maximum of 0.4X at 3220M. Unfortunately the sonic data for this section was not good (due to the limestones) until 3200M and so no conclusions can be drawn from this. Mud weight for this section was 1.35 $.G. we ‘There then followed to T.D. an essestially continuous of sandstone. Pore pressure was expected to remain fairly uniform through the section due to its obvious porosity and permeability, but abnormal pressure continued to rise, and the well flowed at 3466M. Mud weight was consequentley increased from 1.35 5.G. to 1.38 $.G. to kill the well. Due to the absence of good shale sections within the sand from which all drilling parameters are obtained, no forewarning of this continuing rise yetion in pore pressure could be made. THE ANALYSTS Geto Tt is thought that very thin laterally continous stringers of impermeable shales were responsible for partitioning off the sand jection into separate non-connected areas, and as each stringer was crossed, pore pressure could’ rise. 10 metres prior to the flow, the only forwarning of any kind was the increase in back- ground gas levels from 0.1% to 0.38, no connection gases being evident with a maximum of 0.4% (Cl only) from the shut in. Subsequent mud checks on bottoms up and delta chloride measurerients indicated a salt water flow. Mud weight was kept at 1.38 S.G, until 7.D, and no further probleas were encountered. By 3500M the shale content of the rock was sufficient to obtain some trend lines, and both the “D" Exponent and "A" Exponent shoved that pore pressure had started to regress and a normal had once again established. By T.D. pore pressure had regressed to a figure of 1.15 S. G. Subsequent RPT pressure points indicated that pore pressure had ri maximum of 1.38 S.G. in the sand. nto a ‘THE ANALYSTS Secd CONNLUSIONS. Well 15/9-14 reached T.D. on 17th June 1982 48 days after spud, good progress, virtually no downtime and mostly reasonable weather accounting for this. A number of points can be drawn from the data obtained during the drilling of the well. No significant hydrocarbon accumulations were found and the well was not tested, abandonment being initiated soon after T.D. was reached. Despite Garrat Gas Train tests every 100 metré of sulphides or HS was detected no accumulations It is thought that in the 17 1/2" and 12 1/4" hole, locally abnormally pressured sections of short duration (50-100M) , could be contributory to the causes of heaving, sloughing and hydration so often found in these sections, although no hard evidence could be obtained to substantiate this. Some treds could be established in the cretaceous, despite the prescence of the limestones and the fact that the section wi drilled using a turbine assembly. ‘The unexpected continuance of the pore pr jure rise through the Jurassic sands was not predicted due to the lack of shaley sections of sufficient thickness to enable "D" Exponent trends to be established and interpreted, also insufficient shaley material was present to perform bulk density readings, shale factor not being relevant in the Jurassic. Fortunately the kick experienced was not large. More research needs to be performed in the area of pore pressure prediction in essentially sand sequences, as at present in such ‘a situation, prediction methods are not good, relying on data obtained from shale sections only. z wz a7 ee le oe r f it - 6 3 7 a TS van a! a oF ero sau | 02, = Pe - ob _ ia - 0 > oF a ey i avs “i soavwn| *1-6/SueTTORYES saliwad0ld GNW Alva " ee ci ‘I 2 wovanw] we | Fae ®Iaoq) 234 dees tan? a SSLLYadOHd GNA ATIVa Tt atone ae} Haeroor wer [Dror [oes [rime oar 1¢| df xerver] wv leroe [sero | uvxztouxd 2 8] 39°60 cc-o4 9°91 H wSrte bé~se | ves, a] SOTENHOS" SC ‘gONSLTeETO TITHE ac] q crce wu oy 1] sprrvon [wz | vez] “TITWCOREAE |““anaga fod | woee) vez | 1°69] ssl ues fered Love ols] 061 fsr-od on1¢| woul | we9e | win | SFE TE] weer Te a2] 4 sue foz-sd ro pester foi | 6*4] TERNETO FIOH W92/M STON Botta HT zt wei-4_6*P seton uonta wer vine, | Ht, of oz] won| 19] ROHS ONTSVD WOR THTH| a9 POTS sxuvnay “naa |-9'91.| ese | ooo: fsunowauian| -sonze | agar |axvw | zis | mr | on vonoo | “sxnd (um |aaas| Siar aaso | 110 ‘rvaa4| = —b———bacone ‘ONSDve ‘ON TAM ANAND ‘auooay 118 yyy OWA EIS peeree poL~<Sif 21 ee a as[L xe | se scored cox | out | te “ERE NO HO EROHSWA afe[e [ars ams Tifa ara favo NTT P/E yeree fie | Or Tele pore | ase | veztow| ar | om] fe an *VoR muDo “Tver /SpOLSH WOH) 39 | HS | ¥°6 ov do aavodinwinrtah.2¢ /618] a stuns 30 [9°01 | moe sawn | azs | a [on |) | ‘ano | +x wuaso | 8 Twos | aot} ON 3D¥a 6/5, “ON TIM “qTOUNES ANWaWNGO ‘auooay 118 >yyEV STATOIL WELL 15/9-14 DEVIARTON SURVEY RESULTS SIRVEY Ho.
