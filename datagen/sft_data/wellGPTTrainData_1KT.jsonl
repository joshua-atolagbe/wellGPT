The survey utilized echo-sounder and side-scan sonar equipment to map the bathymetry and seabed features. Additionally, a deep towed sparker and an analogue sparker were used to investigate the shallow strata. Digitally recorded multi-channel airgun data were also employed to investigate the deeper strata and to locate any shallow gas pockets."}]}
